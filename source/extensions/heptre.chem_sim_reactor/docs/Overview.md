## Overview

`chem_sim_reactor` is an open-source extension for NVIDIA Omniverse designed to simulate high-fidelity chemical reactions in real-time. It leverages OpenUSD for 3D asset management, NVIDIA PhysX for physics simulation, and GPT-based AI models for generating molecular and reaction data. Ideal for education, research, and immersive simulations.
